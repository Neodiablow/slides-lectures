Some publicly available lecture slides, mainly from courses taught at
Universit√© de Lorraine.

There's a mix of french and english slides.

ssh: Introduction to SSH (Taught in ASRALL, Outils Libres)

## Compiling

Installing build-dependencies:
* Texlive stuff:
 apt-get install --no-install-recommends texlive-latex-extra texlive-latex-recommended texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-fonts-extra
* Additional tools for building and translations:
 apt-get install --no-install-recommends latex-make po4a

To translate the document, po4a is used. You need to edit po4a/po/fr.po, and
run 'make translate' to translate the file and create (e.g.) ssh.fr.tex. Then
pdflatex ssh.fr.tex to generate the PDF, or just 'make ssh.fr.pdf'. There are
high-level tools and plugins for various editors to edit the po file.

Also look at
http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/packaging-tutorial.git/tree/README.translators
(which uses the same toolset for translations)
